# Gorking Build System
I wanted to try and create my own build system, just for fun.

## Todo
- [x] Create a simple build system
- [x] Automatic compilation without build scripts
- [x] Automatic support for `import std;`
- [ ] Use response files for compilation variance
- [ ] Support for compiling libraries
- [ ] Support for compiling unit tests
- [ ] Support for fetching external dependencies from github etc.
- [ ] Support clang/gcc/whatever. Only msvc support for now.

## Note
Yes, I'm aware of the irony of using CMake to make a build system.
