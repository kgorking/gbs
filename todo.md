## 3. Define the Build Process
Outline the steps your build system will perform:

Clean: Remove previous build artifacts.

Compile: Compile source files into object files.

Link: Link object files into an executable.

Run: Optionally, run tests or the executable.


## 7. Documentation and Maintenance
Document your build system to help others (and future you) understand how to use and maintain it.
